# Cross-Review Summary

## 1. Overview
This document summarizes the cross-review analysis of two algorithms:
- **Algorithm A:** Selection Sort with early termination
- **Algorithm B:** Binary Insertion Sort

Both implementations were developed, analyzed, and benchmarked separately, then compared in terms of efficiency, design, and performance.

## 2. Theoretical Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity | Stability |
|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Selection Sort (with early termination) | Ω(n) (if early termination triggers) | Θ(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | ❌ No |
| Binary Insertion Sort | Ω(n log n) | Θ(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | ✅ Yes |

**Summary:**  
Selection Sort guarantees at most *n²/2* comparisons but is not adaptive to partially sorted data.  
Binary Insertion Sort reduces comparisons to *O(n log n)* using binary search, though still needs O(n²) shifts.



## 3. Observations and Discussion
- **Selection Sort:** predictable performance, simple implementation, but limited scalability.
- **Binary Insertion Sort:** fewer comparisons due to binary search but high data movement cost.
- For large inputs, Selection Sort shows stable but slower behavior; Binary Insertion Sort benefits from fewer comparisons but not in total runtime due to memory operations.

## 4. Code Quality Review
- Both implementations follow clear structure and consistent naming.
- Partner’s code leverages `PerformanceTracker` effectively for instrumentation.
- Your implementation efficiently avoids unnecessary swaps via early termination.
- Suggested improvements for both include enhanced exception handling and better modularity.

---

## 5. Conclusions
- **Efficiency:** Binary Insertion Sort performs better for moderately sized arrays.
- **Simplicity:** Selection Sort offers more predictable performance and is easier to maintain.
- **Optimization Potential:** Combining early termination and binary search strategies could yield a hybrid approach with better adaptability.
